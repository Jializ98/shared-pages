## 1. Insert tree id base on WU data

For exploratory analysis, I used the street tree in NYC, with the phenology information established by Yiluan. These trees are part of the whole inventory, covering only 14 genera and being sampled. I select the trees which are within 500-m buffer around the weather underground sites.

```{r}
#| label: tree_wu_sites
#| include: true
#| warning: false

################ For phenology data ################

metadata <- read_csv("~/lab-data/datasets/vegetation/PS/urban/metadata.csv") %>%
  filter(site == "NY")

file_list <- list.files(path = "~/lab-data/datasets/vegetation/PS/urban/doy/", pattern = "^doy_NY_.*\\.rds$", full.names = TRUE)
data_list <- file_list %>%
  map(~ readRDS(.x))
ny_now <- bind_rows(data_list)

tree_location <- metadata %>%
  mutate(genus = str_extract(taxa, "^[^ ]+")) %>%
  left_join(ny_now, by = "id") %>%
  filter(!is.na(doy)) %>%
  st_as_sf(coords = c("lon", "lat"), crs = 4326)

  st_as_sf(coords = c("Lon", "Lat"), crs = 4326)

## 2. Creat the climate variable

### 2.1 Read and clean the WU data (based on GHCNd)

There are 4 raw daily variables selected, i.e. AvgTemp, HighTemp, LowTemp and Precipitation_sum (Sum_mm). I flagged the records which are unknown or questionable according to the methods applied by Global Historical Climatology Network daily [GHCNd](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/land-based-station/global-historical-climatology-network-daily).

```{r}
#| label: read_wu_data
#| include: true
#| warning: false

source("~/phenology-urban/script/read_clean_WU.R")
# all_sites_temp <- read_clean_WU(city = "NY", run_checks = TRUE)
all_sites_temp <- readRDS("~/urban-cooling/data/raw/WU/NY/NY_wu.rds") %>%
  select(c(Date, HighTemp, AvgTemp, LowTemp, Sum_mm, name))
```

### 2.2 Create seasonal temp/prcp variables

The seasonal variable is calculated for each site, year, and season. The season is defined as Winter: December(last year) to February, Spring: March to May, Summer: June to August, Fall: September to November.

```{r}
#| label: create_seasonal_var

#     Avg_AvgTemp = mean(AvgTemp, na.rm = TRUE),
#     Avg_LowTemp = mean(LowTemp, na.rm = TRUE),
#     Sum_Sum_mm = sum(Sum_mm, na.rm = TRUE),

#     Avg_LowTemp = if_else(valid_months_count_LowTemp == 3, Avg_LowTemp, NA_real_),
#     Sum_Sum_mm = if_else(valid_months_count_Sum_mm == 3, Sum_Sum_mm, NA_real_)
#   ) %>%
#   select(name, year, season, Avg_HighTemp, Avg_AvgTemp, Avg_LowTemp, Sum_Sum_mm) %>%
#   pivot_wider(
#     names_from = season,
#     values_from = c(Avg_HighTemp, Avg_AvgTemp, Avg_LowTemp, Sum_Sum_mm),
#     names_glue = "{.value}_{season}"
#   )
# 
# seasonal_temp_doy <- points_in_buffer %>%
#   left_join(seasonal_temp, by = c("Site" = "name", "year" = "year"))
# 
# saveRDS(seasonal_temp_doy, "~/phenology-urban/data/proc/nyc/seasonal_doy.rds")

seasonal_temp_doy <- readRDS("~/phenology-urban/data/proc/nyc/seasonal_doy.rds")
head(seasonal_temp_doy)

### 3.1 Seasonal climate variables

I chose the Acer genus, 50% threshold as an example to plot the relationship. Overall, the warmer the winter/spring temperature, the earlier the spring phenology. The precipitation has no significant impact.

Overall, the warmer the summer temperature, the later the fall phenology. Other relationship are not significant.

In the mixed effect model, I treated the genus as a random effect.

For spring phenology

```{r}

seasonal_temp_doy <- readRDS("~/phenology-urban/data/proc/nyc/seasonal_doy.rds") %>%

  filter(direction =="up" & thres == 0.5)

model <- lmer(doy ~ Avg_AvgTemp_winter  + Sum_Sum_mm_winter  +
                (1 | genus), 
              data = seasonal_temp_doy)

fixed_effects <- tidy(model, effects = "fixed")

fixed_effects_table <- fixed_effects %>%
  select(term, estimate, std.error, statistic) %>%
  mutate(
    estimate = round(estimate, 3),
    std.error = round(std.error, 3),
    p.value = signif(2 * (1 - pnorm(abs(statistic))), 3)
  )

### 3.2 Event period climate

### 3.2.1 Create period temp/prcp variables

The seasonal climate variables use a fixed pre-season for every trees, not allowing heterogeneity within city. Also, the roughly divided season make it difficult to connect to phenology process, e.g. chilling and forcing accumulation. Therefore, some studies use varing preseason or optimal preseason.

[Meng et al., 2020](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0168192319304484?via%3Dihub), [Wang et al., 2021](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/gcb.15777): The preseason was defined as the period from November 1st in the previous year to the time of `SOS` in the current year. (most fixed)

[Meng et al., 2020](https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.1911117117#sec-3), [Yin et al., 2024](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1029/2023EF004127): For each city, the period for which the absolute value of the partial correlation coefficient between `SOS` and `Temp` was highest was considered the optimal length of the preseason most relevant to `SOS`. (more flexible, cadidate time: 0 to 6 months prior to SOS, 5-day interval approach from January 1st to the average SOS date)

Most flexible: The period variable is calculated for each site, year, and growing period. The period is defined as the period between the start of the phenology event and the day of year when the tree reaches the event threshold.

#### 3.2.1 The current event period

I tried `period_length` (start of the event to the day when tree reaches the threshold) as well as `day of year`. However, one issue is that a later `doy` or a longer green-up period already corresponds to warmer weather in the current period.

-   [ ] Should I also explore the optimal pre-season (e.g. for each genus) within the city?

#### 3.2.2 The previous period

The climate condition in the previous period. Temp in dormancy -\> spring phenology. Temp in growing period -\> fall phenology. Compared to current period, the climate of the previous event is not structurally inherently linked to the timing of the subsequent event, and it can help connect to the underlying mechanisms.

For spring phenology, the warmer the dormancy period, the earlier the spring phenology. The warmer the dormancy period，the slower the green-up pace.

## 4 Conclusion and next step

Within the city, the relationship between phenology and temperature is still significant.

-   The warmer the preseason temperature, the earlier the spring phenology.
-   The warmer the preseason temperature, the later the fall phenology.
-   The warmer the dormancy period，the slower the green-up pace. The warmer the growing period，the faster the green-down pace. (consistent results in lmer model)
-   The precipitation has no significant impact.

Next steps:

-   [ ] Find the optimal preseason? Related to [process-based model](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/geb.13932)
-   [ ] Enlarge the samples in NYC.
-   [ ] Add the urban structure variables.
-   [ ] Enlarge the city samples (downloading WU in other 6 cities).

Juwon conducted research on the impact of climate change on urban trees, focusing specifically on changes in the start of the growing season in New York. He and Prof. Seto plan to expand this approach across the U.S., and he looks forward to potential collaborations.
