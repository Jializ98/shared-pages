## Introduction

-   Phenology, the timing of periodic plant life cycle events, is sensitive to biotic and abiotic environment, especially the temperature (Meng et al., 2020).

-   The significant Urban Heat Island effect leads to the shifts in urban phenology (L. Yang et al., 2023; Y. Zhou, 2022)

    -   Treat city as a whole.
    -   Compare it to rural areas.

-   Spatial unevenness of urban thermal environment might lead to the heterogeneity of phenology within the city.

    -   Negative correlation between the flowering date and the monthly mean LST in February–April.

    ![Katz et al., 2019](docs/katz_2019.png){#fig-katz_2019 fig-align="center" width="60%"}

    -   A significant spatial variation for First flowing date of 35 species, which negatively correlated withdaily LST.

    ![Xing et al., 2022](docs/xing_2022.png){#fig-xing_2022 fig-align="center" width="60%"}

## Question and Hypothesis

-   **Question**: What is the spatial heterogeneity of individual tree phenology within a city, and across cities located in different climate regions? (genus and species level)

-   **Hypothesis**:

    -   There is a significant spatial heterogeneity.
    -   Spatial heterogeneity in urban phenology is driven by the heterogeneous urban thermal environment
    -   The magnitude and direction of this effect may differ among cities.

-   **Goal**:

    -   Insights into how vegetation adapts to altered environmental conditions under urbanization.
    -   Addresses the biological and societal consequences of phenological changes.

## 1 Raw data

### 1.1 Read and clean the WU data (based on GHCNd)

The urban microclimate information comes from the [Weather Underground program](https://www.wunderground.com/). There are 4 raw daily variables selected, i.e. AvgTemp, HighTemp, LowTemp and SumPrcp. I flagged the records which are unknown or questionable according to the methods applied by Global Historical Climatology Network daily [GHCNd](https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/products/land-based-station/global-historical-climatology-network-daily).

For initial analysis, I collect the date from 4 cities, i.e. New York, Houston, Detroit, and Seattle.

### 1.2 Shortwave data from Daymet

To control for the influence of other variables on phenology, I also incorporated shortwave radiation data derived from the [Daymet daily dataset](https://daymet.ornl.gov/) with a 1 km resolution. Shortwave radiation was extracted for the specific locations of the trees.

```{r}
#| label: fig-plot_daymet
#| include: true
#| fig-cap: "The shortwave radiation raster in 2023-01-01, NY"
#| warning: false

# download

city = "NY"
data_dir <- paste0("~/phenology-urban/data/raw/", city, "/Daymet/daily2016-2024/")
file <- list.files(data_dir, pattern = "srad_daily_2023_ncss\\.nc$", full.names = TRUE)
srad_nc <- terra::rast(file)

srad_df <- as.data.frame(srad_nc[[1]], xy = TRUE)
ggplot(srad_df, aes(x = x, y = y, fill = srad_1)) +
  geom_raster() +

```

### 1.3 Select the street tree base on WU data

I used the street tree in the above 4 cities, with the phenology records established by Yiluan. These trees are part of the whole inventory, covering 14 genera and being sampled. I select the trees which are within **500 m** buffer around the Weather Underground sites (see @fig-tree_wu_sites2).

```

## 2 Method

### 2.1 Phenological indicators

The tree locations points were overlapped with Planetscope imageries to extract the reflectance values. After smoothing and regression, we could get the EVI curve. The phenological metrics were calculated based on the EVI curve:

![Extract reflectance from PlanetScope based on tree location, an example in NY](docs/ps_example.png){#fig-ps_example fig-align="center" width="60%"}

![Phenology metrics calculated based on EVI curve from PlanetScope](docs/pheno_matrix.png){#fig-pheno_matrics}

-   Spring phenology

    -   `SOS`: Defined as the day of year when individual tree growing season EVI curves first cross the green-up 50% threshold.
    -   `Green-up Pace`: Defined as the time span (in days) required for the individual tree growing season EVI curves to transition from the green-up 20% threshold to the 80% threshold.

-   Fall phenology

    -   `EOS`: Defined as the day of year when individual tree growing season EVI curves first cross the green-down 50% threshold.
    -   `Green-down Pace`: Defined as the time span (in days) required for the individual tree growing season EVI curves to transition from the green-down 20% threshold to the 80% threshold.

-   Preseason: Defined as the time span (in days) to calculate the average temperature and precipitation.

    -   `SOS`: Winter.
    -   `Green-up Pace`: Spring
    -   `EOS`: Summer
    -   `Green-down Pace`: Fall

### 2.2 Spatial model

I modeled the relationship between the phenology and environmental covariates using a spatial hierarchical model. The response variable (phenology parameter) at location $\mathbf{s}_i$ and in year $\mathbf{t}$, denoted as $y(\mathbf{s}_i, \mathbf{t})$, was modeled as following model:

**Model:**

$$y(\mathbf{s}_i, \mathbf{t}) = \mu(\mathbf{s}_i,\mathbf{t}) + w(\mathbf{s}_i) + u(\mathbf{t}) + \epsilon(\mathbf{s}_i, \mathbf{t})$$

where:

-   *Fixed Effects*: $$\mu(\mathbf{s}_i,\mathbf{t}) = \mathbf{X}_{\mathbf{s}_i,\mathbf{t}} \boldsymbol{\beta}$$

    -   $\mathbf{X}_{\mathbf{s}_i,\mathbf{t}} = [1, \text{AvgTemp}_{\mathbf{s}_i,\mathbf{t}}, \text{Precp}_{\mathbf{s}_i,\mathbf{t}}, \text{srad}_{\mathbf{s}_i,\mathbf{t}}]$ is the design matrix of predictors.
    -   $\boldsymbol{\beta} = [\beta_0, \beta_1, \beta_2, \beta_3]$ are the regression coefficients for the intercept and covariates.
    -   $\beta_1$ is the coefficient for the average temperature, which is the main interest in this study.

-   *Spatially Correlated Random Effect*: $$w(\mathbf{s}_i) \sim \text{MVN}(\mathbf{0}, \mathbf{R})$$

    -   $\mathbf{R}$ is the spatial correlation matrix defined by a covariance function.

    -   In INLA, a spatial process with a Matérn covariance can be obtained as the weak solution to a stochastic partial differential equation (SPDE). The SPDE method uses the Finite Element Method (FEM) to approximate a spatial Gaussian Random Field (GRF). It constructs a triangulated mesh, where each node serves as a basis for interpolation. Basis functions are defined to be 1 at a node and decay to 0 at neighboring triangles, ensuring local influence. By discretizing the SPDE, the problem transforms into a sparse Gaussian Markov Random Field (GMRF), making computations more efficient for large spatial datasets.

        -   Matérn Covariance Function (if selected): $$\mathbf{R}_{ij} = \sigma^2 \cdot \frac{2^{1-\nu}}{\Gamma(\nu)} \left(\frac{\sqrt{2\nu} D_{ij}}{\rho}\right)^\nu K_\nu\left(\frac{\sqrt{2\nu} D_{ij}}{\rho}\right)$$

-   *Year-specific Random Effect*: $$u(\mathbf{t}) \sim \text{N}(0, \tau^2_{\mathbf{t}})$$

    -   $u_{\mathbf{t}}$ captures year-to-year variability, with $\tau^2_{\mathbf{t}}$ being the variance of the year effect.

-   *Independent Nugget Effect*: $$\epsilon(\mathbf{s}_i) \sim \text{N}(0, \tau^2)$$

    -   $\epsilon(\mathbf{s}_i, \mathbf{t})$ accounts for measurement error or small-scale variability.

**Get the posterior distribution of model parameters**:

-   **INLA**: In `INLA` package, the Integrated Nested Laplace Approximation (INLA) was used to approximate the posterior distribution of the model parameters. Rather than estimating the joint posterior distribution of the parameters via MCMC, INLA focusing on individual posterior marginals of the model parameters, which is enough to make inference of the model parameters and latent effects in most cases.

## 3 Results

### 3.1 Genus level

#### New York City

Most genera showed negative association between temperature and the SOS, either significant or insignificant, suggesting the warmer winter, the earilier start of season. There are significant genus-level differences in how temperature influences the spring phenology.

The response to temperature is more consistent in the EOS. The response to temperature is positive for all genera, suggesting the warmer summer, the later end of season.

For GreenUp and GreenDown, there is not significant association between temperature and the phenology metrics.

```

#### Comparison across 4 cities

The response of SOS and EOS to temperature is consistent across cities: the warmer winter, the earilier start of season; the warmer summer, the later end of season.

The difference in response among cities is obvious. For SOS, most genera all cities showed negative association between temperature and the start of season. Only some genera in DV and ST had a positive association.

For EOS, the difference among cities is the most obvious. Genera in NY and ST had a higher positive association than those genera in DV. **Precipitation/humidity/elevation?**

## 4 Conclusion and next step

### Conclusion

-   Within the city, trees indeed respond to temperature variation, result in phenology variation.

-   Across cities, response variation patterns noticed.

### Next steps

-   **What can the urban phenology heterogenity be used for?** - Goal

    -   The preview of future warming: compared with the sensitivity in natural environment.

    -   Fine-scale urban phenology: compared with other urban phenology sensitivity detected at coarser scale

-   Scale up

    -   Cities
    -   Genera
