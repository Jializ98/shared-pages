Also, the roughly divided season make it difficult to connect to phenology process, e.g. chilling and forcing accumulation. Therefore, some studies use varing preseason or optimal preseason.\nMeng et al., 2020, Wang et al., 2021: The preseason was defined as the period from November 1st in the previous year to the time of SOS in the current year. (most fixed)\nMeng et al., 2020, Yin et al., 2024: For each city, the period for which the absolute value of the partial correlation coefficient between SOS and Temp was highest was considered the optimal length of the preseason most relevant to SOS. (more flexible, cadidate time: 0 to 6 months prior to SOS, 5-day interval approach from January 1st to the average SOS date)\nMost flexible: The period variable is calculated for each site, year, and growing period.
